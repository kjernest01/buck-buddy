# buck-buddy
Buck-buddy is an Artificially Intelligent simulated system that runs on human style reasoning to develop a personalized cost-efficient partner that incorporates a wide range of subscriptions and budget spending based on the year, the month, and the day. This logic program was built using the s(CASP) automated reasoning system.

	The Buck-buddy intelligence system analyzes pre-existing data sets to make a logical decision of asking the user about the continuation of an ongoing “subscription”. This decision will be made based on data records of user usage.

	Another important functionality of Buck-buddy is that it uses human reasoning to help the user make an informed decision on how to be more cost-efficient when it comes to “budgeting” on different billing cycles. A really important feature of the program is that it generates a monthly reminder to economize for unexpected emergencies.
